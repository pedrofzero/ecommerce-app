# E-commerce shop

This app is a simple e-commerce shop built with React.
It uses React-Router for route management, Redux along redux-persist for persistent state management, and Stripe (in progress 👨🏻‍💻).
Back-end is a node.js web server w/ MySQL.

Styling needs a lot of fixing, which I'll get to later.

There will be a link soon once I figure out some deployment issues!
